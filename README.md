Application Concept:
Once the Affordable Care Act was signed into law in 2010, having health insurance became mandatory. Deciding on a plan can be laborious especially with for those with low health literacy. The target population for our project are young adults looking to find a health plan that fits their needs.

User Stories:
A.	User should be able to log in
B.	User should be able to add information to their profile
C.	User should be able to input their healthcare needs and health symptoms 
D.	Gather data from users to assess their health needs
E.	Based on the information we gather about user’s health need; application will provide a system that determines the best health plans for users
F.	Create a public and private key that would indicate what information belongs to what user without showing an obvious public connection of which public keys belong to which private keys. 

Completion Times for User Stories: 
a.	User should be able to log in: 5 days
b.	User should be able to add information to their profile: 5 days
c.	User should be able to select their health symptoms and needs:  4 days
d.	Gather data from users to assess their health needs:  1 month
e.	Based on the information we gather about user’s health need; application will provide a system that determines the best health plans for users:  1 month 
f.	Create a public and private key that would indicate what information belongs to what user without showing an obvious public connection of which public keys belong to which private keys: 3 days

Example of User Stories: 
•	I am a F1 visa student. I go to the gym a lot. I have noticed occasionally that I tend to strain some of my muscles after a hard work out.  I am looking for the best insurance plan for me in case I injure myself. 
•	I am a 25-year-old who is about to be dropped from my parent’s health plan. I engage in multiple risky behaviors in addition to having multiple mental health problems.  I want to have a health plan that will address my needs for the lowest cost. 
•	I am a 23-year-old student who just found out I am pregnant. I still haven’t decided what I want to do so I’d like to know my different options regarding abortion, adoption, and maternal child health.
•	I am uninsured and have been recently diagnosed with cervical cancer. I would like to know what services and treatments are available to me.
•	Currently, I am a 20-year-old student who is in the middle of joining a sorority. I have decided to live in the house owned by my sorority.  I blacked out and slept with a guy and did not realize that protection was not used. After being in pain and noticed a rash, I consulted Web MD. I have realized there is a high chance that I contracted herpes. I hope there is a plan the offers a reduced cost on generic drugs. 
•	I am a 22-year-old transgender female who was recently diagnosed with HIV. This situation prompted me to stop using crystal meth. I need rehabilitation services and long-term HIV care.  In addition, I was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, therefore I need dialectical behavioral therapy.
