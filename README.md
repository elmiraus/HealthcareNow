Completion Times for User Stories: 
a.	User should be able to log in: 5 days
b.	User should be able to add information to their profile: 5 days
c.	User should be able to select their health symptoms and needs:  4 days
d.	Gather data from users to assess their health needs:  1 month
e.	Based on the information we gather about user’s health need; application will provide a system that determines the best health plans for users:  1 month 
f.	Create a public and private key that would indicate what information belongs to what user without showing an obvious public connection of which public keys belong to which private keys: 3 days

Example of User Stories: 
•	I am a F1 visa student. I go to the gym a lot. I have noticed occasionally that I tend to strain some of my muscles after a hard work out.  I am looking for the best insurance plan for me in case I injure myself. 
•	I am a 25-year-old who is about to be dropped from my parent’s health plan. I engage in multiple risky behaviors in addition to having multiple mental health problems.  I want to have a health plan that will address my needs for the lowest cost. 
•	I am a 23-year-old student who just found out I am pregnant. I still haven’t decided what I want to do so I’d like to know my different options regarding abortion, adoption, and maternal child health.
•	I am uninsured and have been recently diagnosed with cervical cancer. I would like to know what services and treatments are available to me.
•	Currently, I am a 20-year-old student who is in the middle of joining a sorority. I have decided to live in the house owned by my sorority.  I blacked out and slept with a guy and did not realize that protection was not used. After being in pain and noticed a rash, I consulted Web MD. I have realized there is a high chance that I contracted herpes. I hope there is a plan the offers a reduced cost on generic drugs. 
•	I am a 22-year-old transgender female who was recently diagnosed with HIV. This situation prompted me to stop using crystal meth. I need rehabilitation services and long-term HIV care.  In addition, I was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, therefore I need dialectical behavioral therapy.
